# PyBOMBS: Common dependencies

This Docker container will provide a full installation of the latest PyBOMBS,
and will initialize an empty prefix. Furthermore, it will contain the most
common dependencies for most GNU Radio-related recipes. Calling `pybombs
install` will not only work without issues, it'll also be pretty fast as it
doesn't need install lots of dependencies.
